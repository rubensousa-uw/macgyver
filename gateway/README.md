# macgyver Gateway (hosted action agent, beta)

Run macgyver's action agent in the cloud so users don't have to install and
host a local agent on their own machine. The gateway speaks the exact protocol
the iOS/Android apps already use (OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` +
the WebSocket event channel), and drives
[Anthropic Managed Agents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview)
behind it: one durable session per user, a mounted long-term memory store, a
per-user credential vault, and a hosted sandbox for tool execution (web search,
files, bash) — no sandbox infrastructure to operate.

              Anthropic Managed Agents (beta)
                1 shared agent config + environment
                1 session + memory store + vault per user
```

## Quick start

```bash
cd gateway
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and GATEWAY_TOKENS
npm run provision           # creates the shared environment + agent (once)
npm run dev                 # gateway on :8788
```

`GATEWAY_TOKENS` maps client tokens to user ids, e.g.
`GATEWAY_TOKENS="s3cret-a:alice,s3cret-b:bob"`. Each user's session, memory
store, and vault are provisioned lazily on first request (or eagerly via
`npm run provision -- alice bob`).

**App setup** (Settings → Agent): host = `http://<gateway-host>`, port = `8788`,
gateway token = the user's token. Local self-hosted mode keeps working — this
is an alternative backend, not a replacement.

## Endpoints

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/chat/completions` | reachability probe (the app's connection check) |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | one agent turn. Sends only the newest user message — the managed session owns durable history (server-side compaction included). With `"stream": true`, responds with OpenAI-style SSE chunks generated live from the agent's output |
| `POST /context` | queue voice-session context (`{"context": "..."}`); it attaches to the user's next turn as a system-level event (the API rejects standalone system messages) |
| `GET /tasks?limit=N` | recent delegated tasks + results, for the app's Recent Tasks view |
| `GET /apps` | connectable apps and whether this user has linked each one |
| `GET /connect/:app?token=…` | starts the OAuth flow (open in an in-app auth sheet); the callback stores an `mcp_oauth` credential in the user's vault |
| `ws://host:port` | event channel; same protocol-v3 handshake as the local gateway. Late task results arrive as `heartbeat` events, scheduled-task summaries as `cron` events |

## Two-speed turns

`POST /v1/chat/completions` waits up to `QUICK_ANSWER_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30s).
If the agent is still working, the call returns an acknowledgement immediately
and the final result is pushed over the WebSocket when it lands — the voice
layer never blocks on a long task. The same budget applies to streaming
requests: past it, the stream closes with an acknowledgement chunk and the
final text arrives as a proactive event.

## Connecting apps

Extensions are MCP servers declared once on the shared agent config, with
per-user OAuth credentials in that user's vault (Anthropic refreshes the
tokens). Adding one means a new entry in `src/apps.ts` — the connect routes,
the vault write, and the `/apps` listing are generic. Entries are offered only
when enabled and their MCP URL resolves, so a self-hosted app stays hidden
until it is deployed.

After the OAuth callback the gateway makes one real `tools/call` against the
server before reporting success: a valid grant does not guarantee the server
will serve that account, and "connected" should not claim otherwise.

### Google Calendar

Google's own Calendar MCP server (`calendarmcp.googleapis.com`) is **disabled in
the registry**. It ships under the Google Workspace Developer Preview Program:
with a personal Gmail account `initialize` and `tools/list` succeed but every
`tools/call` returns "The caller does not have permission" — verified with a
direct token call, while the same token works fine against the Calendar REST
API. It needs a Workspace account plus preview enrollment, so it cannot serve
consumer users.

Instead, run [`taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp`](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp)
(MIT) in external-OAuth mode, where it accepts the bearer token the vault
injects rather than running its own OAuth flow, and calls the Google REST APIs
underneath — which works with consumer accounts:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e MCP_ENABLE_OAUTH21=true \
  -e EXTERNAL_OAUTH21_PROVIDER=true \
  -e GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="<same client id the gateway uses>" \
  -e WORKSPACE_MCP_TOOLS="calendar" \
  workspace-mcp --transport streamable-http --read-only
```

Then point the gateway at it — the app stays hidden until this is set:

```
WORKSPACE_MCP_URL=https://your-workspace-mcp.example.com/mcp/
```

The same deployment also serves Gmail, Tasks, Drive and more: widen
`WORKSPACE_MCP_TOOLS` and add a registry entry with the matching scopes.

To set up the Google side:

1. Create a Google Cloud project; enable **Google Calendar API** and
   **Google Calendar MCP API**.
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen and set publishing status to **In
   production** — in *Testing* status Google expires refresh tokens after 7
   days, which silently breaks stored credentials.
3. Create a Web application OAuth client with redirect URI
   `<PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/connect/gcal-self/callback`; put the id/secret in `.env`.
4. Unverified apps are capped at 100 users and show a warning screen; submit
   for sensitive-scope verification to lift both.

On-device alternative: the iOS app also exposes calendar and reminder tools
backed by EventKit, which need no OAuth at all. Those cover interactive asks;
the connected app is what lets background and scheduled tasks reach the
calendar when the phone is asleep.

## Notes and roadmap

- Managed Agents is an Anthropic **beta**; quotas apply (notably scheduled
  deployments are capped per organization).
- Memory is a per-user mounted store of small text files, versioned and
  redactable server-side.
- Roadmap: more connectable apps (Gmail, Notion, Linear), scheduled reminders
  via deployments, tool-permission prompts surfaced as spoken confirmations,
  Android parity for the backend switcher and local tools.
